## Problem Section

### Headline
**Claude Code is powerful. But are you using it right?**

### Body
You've seen what Claude Code can do. But after a few sessions, something feels off:

- Claude keeps "forgetting" decisions you made an hour ago
- You're not sure what should go in CLAUDE.md (or that it exists)
- You've heard about "skills" and "agents" but never set them up
- Your projects start messy and stay messy

**It's not Claude. It's context rot.**

Every commit changes your code. Your documentation doesn't keep up. Claude loses track. You lose time.

---

## Solution Section

### Headline
**Best practices, installed.**

### Body
Project Jumpstart is what experienced Claude Code users wish they had on day one.

We set you up with everything that works — CLAUDE.md templates, skills, agents, documentation standards — then keep it all current automatically.

**You build. We maintain.**

---

## Three Pillars Section

### Pillar 1: Start Right

**Don't start from scratch.**

- **Project Kickstart** — Describe what you're building, get a complete project setup
- **CLAUDE.md Generator** — AI-powered, tailored to your tech stack
- **Skills Library** — Pre-built skills for common tasks (commits, PRs, testing)
- **Agents Library** — Ready-to-use agents for code review, refactoring, docs

*"I didn't know Claude Code could do this."* — Every new user

---

### Pillar 2: Stay Current

**Documentation that maintains itself.**

- **Auto-Update Git Hooks** — Missing doc headers? Generated at commit time
- **File Watcher** — Detects when code changes outpace documentation
- **One-Click Refresh** — Update all stale docs in seconds
- **Activity Tracking** — See what changed and when

*Your documentation is outdated after your next commit. Ours isn't.*

---

### Pillar 3: Stay Healthy

**Know before things break.**

- **Health Score** — See your project's documentation health at a glance
- **Context Rot Alerts** — Warnings before Claude starts forgetting
- **Quick Wins** — Prioritized suggestions for maximum impact
- **Enforcement Options** — Warn, block, or auto-fix at commit time

*Green means Claude remembers. Red means trouble.*

---

## How It Works Section

### Step 1: Add Your Project
Point Project Jumpstart at any codebase. We detect your tech stack automatically.

### Step 2: Generate Best Practices
One click creates your CLAUDE.md, suggests relevant skills and agents, sets up documentation standards.

### Step 3: Enable Auto-Pilot
Turn on git hooks and file watching. Documentation stays current without you thinking about it.

### Step 4: Build With Confidence
Claude Code works better because your context never rots.

## FAQ Section

**What is context rot?**
When your code changes but your documentation doesn't, Claude Code loses track of your project. It "forgets" decisions, asks redundant questions, and makes mistakes. Context rot is the gap between your code and Claude's understanding of it.

**Do I need to know Claude Code best practices?**
No — that's the point. Project Jumpstart encodes best practices automatically. You get the benefit without the learning curve.

**Will this slow down my commits?**
The git hooks add a few seconds at most. Auto-update mode generates missing docs in the background. Most users don't notice.

**What if I already have a CLAUDE.md?**
Great! Project Jumpstart will analyze it, suggest improvements, and help keep it current as your project evolves.

**Is my code sent anywhere?**
Documentation generation uses the Anthropic API (your API key). Your code stays local. Nothing is stored on our servers.
